# **imprint**  | Human-in-the-Loop Crowdsourcing Platform

imprint is a human-in-the-loop crowdsourcing application for data collection and continuous integration with machine learning model training.

üí° Current Use Case
> Crowd-powered labeling of sidewalk obstructions and walkability for sidewalk obstruction detection research.

üîß Features
- Interactive image annotation interface
- Real-time data dashboard with annotation history

üîç Project Goals
- Build a general-purpose platform for human-in-the-loop annotation tasks.
- Improve voluntary crowdsourcing by encouraging crowdworkers to contribute in the development of ML models.
- Support scalable data collection for training, validation, and testing of AI systems.

üöÄ Roadmap
- [ ] Develop and deploy base and modified version of imprint for mini-HCI study.
    - [x] Create new database and upload sidewalk data
    - [x] Modify registration to include frequently walked cities of users
    - [x] Implement new city-based algorithm for modified version
    - [ ] Implement visualization after successful annotation for modified version
    - [ ] Add feedback/popups after successful annotation for modified version 
    - [ ] Reframe prompt on asking users to continue annotation session
    - [ ] Finalize overall look and feel of the platform  
- [ ] Implement video annotation through freezing the frame and stabilization.
- [ ] Implement an open-source form generator for generlizability of the crowdsourcing application.
- [ ] Develop tool to integrate annotated data for machine learning projects.
