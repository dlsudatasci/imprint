                    <H3 className="mb-2"> Overview</H3>
                    <P> Greetings! I am Francis Bawa and I'm currently working on my Master's thesis at De La Salle University titled &quot;Advancing Urban Planning Through Sidwalk 
                        Obstruction Detection Near Key Transit Areas with Human-in-the-Loop Object Detection and Recognition&quot;. In this study, I'm trying to implement a sidewalk
                        obstruction detection tool purely from the help of volunteers like you by using this human-in-the-loop system. Currently, I'm still trying to finalize the overall
                        look and feel of the website as well as work on the integration of the annotated data in machine learning models.</P>
                    <br />
                    <P> My current focus is a mini-HCI study titled &quot;Enhancing Urban Crowdsourcing through Motivational Designs.&quot; This project explores how to effectively motivate users to contribute data voluntarily and meaningfully to support machine learning development.
                        At this stage, I are currently looking for volunteers to help annotate images of sidewalks by labeling obstructions, which will be used to re-train a computer vision model to automatically detect these obstacles in the future. To ensure successful model retraining, imprint will need a large volume of labeled data.
                        Your participation will directly support research on urban accessibility and the advancement of human-in-the-loop AI systems.</P>
                    <br />
